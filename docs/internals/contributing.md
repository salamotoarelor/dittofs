## Getting Started

### Using Nix (Recommended)

The easiest way to get a complete development environment is using [Nix](https://nixos.org/):

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/marmos91/dittofs.git
cd dittofs

# Enter development shell (installs all dependencies automatically)
nix develop

# Or with direnv (auto-activates when entering directory)
direnv allow

# Set up pre-commit hooks (recommended)
make setup-hooks

# Build and run
go build -o dfs cmd/dfs/main.go
./dfs init
./dfs start
```

The Nix flake provides:
- Go 1.26 with gopls, delve debugger
- golangci-lint for code quality
- NFS utilities for E2E testing (Linux)
- ACL libraries for POSIX compliance testing
- pjdfstest for POSIX compliance testing (Linux)
- pynfs for NFSv4 protocol conformance, as `pynfs-4.0` and `pynfs-4.1`
- `dfs-postgres-start` / `dfs-postgres-stop` for a PostgreSQL test container

`nix flake check` builds both binaries and runs the conformance graders, which is
what decides whether a suite run counts as green.

The binaries also run straight from the flake, without a clone:

```bash
nix run github:marmos91/dittofs#dfs -- start
nix run github:marmos91/dittofs#dfsctl -- --help
```

### Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer not to use Nix, install dependencies manually:

#### Prerequisites

- Go 1.26 or higher
- NFS client tools (for E2E testing)
  - Linux: `nfs-common` package
  - macOS: Built-in NFS client
- Git

### Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/marmos91/dittofs.git
cd dittofs

# Set up pre-commit hooks (recommended)
make setup-hooks

# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Build
go build -o dfs cmd/dfs/main.go

# Run with development settings
./dfs init
DITTOFS_LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG ./dfs start
```

## Development Workflow

### Building

```bash
# Build the main binary
go build -o dfs cmd/dfs/main.go

# Install dependencies
go mod download
```

### Running

```bash
# Run server with defaults (NFS port 12049, INFO logging)
./dfs start

# Run with debug logging and custom settings
DITTOFS_LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG ./dfs start

# Use environment variables for quick config overrides
DITTOFS_LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG DITTOFS_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT=60s ./dfs start
```

Protocol adapters are stored in the control-plane database. After logging in
with `dfsctl`, use `dfsctl adapter edit nfs --port 12049` to set the NFS port;
`DITTOFS_ADAPTERS_*` variables do not configure adapters.

### Pre-commit Hooks

DittoFS includes pre-commit hooks that automatically check formatting and run static analysis before each commit. Set them up once after cloning:

```bash
make setup-hooks
```

The hook checks `gofmt -s` on staged Go files, then runs `go vet ./...` and `golangci-lint run` (if installed) across the full repository. Use `git commit --no-verify` to skip when needed (e.g., WIP commits).

### Linting and Formatting

```bash
# Format code
make fmt          # or: gofmt -s -w .

# Static analysis
make vet          # or: go vet ./...

# Run linters (if golangci-lint is installed)
make lint         # or: golangci-lint run

# Check MS-FSCC / MS-FSA / MS-SMB2 citations in comments against the spec
# section maps vendored under test/spec-citations/
go run ./test/spec-citations
```

See `test/spec-citations/README.md` for what that check does and does not decide, and for how
the section maps are refreshed when a spec revision is bumped.

### Vulnerability checks

Run `make vulncheck` from the repository root to scan both Go modules with a
pinned version of [govulncheck](https://go.dev/doc/security/vuln/). Both scans
run even if one fails; the command returns nonzero for findings or scan errors.
Use `make vulncheck-main` or `make vulncheck-operator` to scan one module.

This is an opt-in check and does not change CI or Git hooks. It needs network
access to download the scanner and query the Go vulnerability database, and
can use several GiB of memory. Results depend on the active Go toolchain,
platform, build settings, and current database; tests are not included in the
scan. Check `go version` when a report identifies standard-library issues.
The initial Go 1.26.0 baseline reports standard-library vulnerabilities, so a
nonzero result is expected until the compiler is updated and findings reviewed.

## Testing

### Unit Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run with race detection
go test -race ./...

# Run specific package
go test ./pkg/metadata/store/memory/
```

### Integration Tests

```bash
# Run integration tests (S3, BadgerDB, etc.)
go test -v ./test/integration/...
```

### E2E Testing Framework

DittoFS includes a comprehensive end-to-end testing framework that validates real-world NFS operations by:

- **Starting a real DittoFS server** with configurable backends
- **Mounting the NFS filesystem** using platform-native mount commands
- **Executing real file operations** using standard Go `os` package functions
- **Testing all combinations** of adapters and storage backends

Test suites cover:

- Basic file operations (create, read, write, delete)
- Directory operations (mkdir, readdir, rename)
- Symbolic and hard links
- File attributes and permissions
- Idempotency guarantees
- Edge cases and boundary conditions

Run these commands from the repository root. The runner supplies the required
`e2e` build tag; preserving `PATH` lets it find Go when running under `sudo`.

```bash
# Run E2E tests (requires root privileges and an NFS client)
sudo env "PATH=$PATH" ./test/e2e/run-e2e.sh --verbose

# Run specific E2E suite
sudo env "PATH=$PATH" ./test/e2e/run-e2e.sh --verbose --test '^TestNFSv4BasicOperations$'

# Test the in-memory metadata and block stores
sudo env "PATH=$PATH" ./test/e2e/run-e2e.sh --verbose --test '^TestStoreMatrixOperations$/^memory$/^memory$'
```

NFSv4/v4.1 tests are in `internal/adapter/nfs/v4/handlers/` and cover sessions, delegations, ACLs, and Kerberos.

See `test/e2e/` for detailed documentation.

### NFS Client Testing

```bash
# Mount on Linux
sudo mount -t nfs -o nfsvers=3,tcp,port=12049,mountport=12049 localhost:/export /mnt/test

# Mount on macOS (requires resvport)
sudo mount -t nfs -o nfsvers=3,tcp,port=12049,mountport=12049,resvport localhost:/export /mnt/test

# Test operations
cd /mnt/test
ls -la
echo "test" > file.txt
cat file.txt

# Unmount
sudo umount /mnt/test
```

## Benchmarking

DittoFS includes a comprehensive benchmark suite for performance testing:

```bash
# Run comprehensive benchmark suite (separate from tests)
./scripts/benchmark.sh

# Run with profiling (CPU and memory)
./scripts/benchmark.sh --profile

# Compare with previous results
./scripts/benchmark.sh --compare

# Custom configuration
BENCH_TIME=30s BENCH_COUNT=5 ./scripts/benchmark.sh

# Run specific benchmarks manually
go test -bench='BenchmarkE2E/memory/ReadThroughput' -benchtime=20s ./test/e2e/
go test -bench='BenchmarkE2E/filesystem' -benchmem ./test/e2e/

# Generate CPU profile for specific benchmark
go test -bench=BenchmarkE2E/memory/WriteThroughput/100MB \
    -cpuprofile=cpu.prof -benchtime=30s ./test/e2e/

# Analyze profile
go tool pprof cpu.prof
go tool pprof -http=:8080 cpu.prof
```

**Important**: Benchmarks are stress tests designed to push DittoFS to its limits. They:
- Test with files from 4KB to 100MB
- Create thousands of files/directories
- Run mixed concurrent workloads
- Profile CPU and memory usage
- Compare different storage backends

Results are saved to `benchmark_results/<timestamp>/` and should NOT be committed to the repository.

See `test/e2e/BENCHMARKS.md` for detailed documentation and `test/e2e/COMPARISON_GUIDE.md` for comparing with other NFS implementations.

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding a New NFS Procedure

1. Add handler in `internal/adapter/nfs/v3/handlers/` or `internal/adapter/nfs/mount/handlers/`
2. Implement XDR request/response parsing
3. Extract auth context from call
4. Delegate business logic to repository methods
5. Update dispatch table in `dispatch.go`
6. Add test coverage

Example:
```go
// internal/adapter/nfs/v3/handlers/myproc.go
func HandleMyProc(ctx context.Context, call *rpc.Call, metadata metadata.Store) (*rpc.Reply, error) {
    // 1. Parse XDR request
    req := xdr.DecodeMyProcArgs(call.Body)

    // 2. Extract auth context
    authCtx := dispatch.ExtractAuthContext(call)

    // 3. Delegate to repository
    result, err := metadata.MyOperation(ctx, authCtx, req.Handle)

    // 4. Encode response
    return xdr.EncodeMyProcRes(result), nil
}
```

### Adding a New Store Backend

DittoFS uses a Service-oriented architecture where **stores are simple CRUD interfaces**. Business logic (permission checking, caching, locking) lives in the Service layer (`MetadataService`) and the per-share `BlockStore` engine.

**Metadata Store:**

1. Implement `pkg/metadata/MetadataStore` interface (simple CRUD operations)
2. Handle file handle generation (must be unique and stable)
3. Implement root directory creation (`CreateRootDirectory`)
4. Ensure thread safety (concurrent access across shares)
5. Consider persistence strategy for handles
6. Implement `EnumerateFileChunks(ctx, authCtx, fn)` using a backend-native cursor (no full-set load, honors `ctx.Done()`); pass the v0.15.0 conformance scenarios in `pkg/metadata/storetest/`. See [IMPLEMENTING_STORES.md](implementing-stores.md#metadatastoreenumeratefilechunks-v0150-phase-11).
7. **Note**: Permission checking is handled by `MetadataService`, not stores

**Block Store (Local):**

1. Implement the `pkg/block/journal.LocalStore` interface. It is the
   journal-native surface keyed by `(payloadID, offset)` — `WriteAt`,
   `ReadAt`, `Hydrate`, `Commit`, `Truncate`, `Delete` — plus carve,
   eviction, lifecycle and retention methods. See `pkg/block/journal/localstore.go`
   for the full list.
2. Storage is payload-keyed, NOT content-addressed: the local tier is a
   per-file byte cache, so it does not implement `block.Store`.
3. Each share gets an isolated local storage directory
4. The `pkg/block/blockstoretest/` suites do not apply here — they target the
   hash-keyed and block-keyed remote surfaces. Model tests on the existing
   package tests under `pkg/block/journal/`.

**Block Store (Remote):**

1. Implement `pkg/block/remote.RemoteStore` interface. It embeds `RemoteBlockStore`,
   `ChunkReader` and `ChunkSealer`, and adds `HealthCheck`, `Healthcheck`, and
   `Close` — see `pkg/block/remote/remote.go`.
2. Remote stores are shared across shares via ref counting
3. Test with the `RemoteBlockStoreConformance` suite in `pkg/block/blockstoretest/`

See [IMPLEMENTING_STORES.md](implementing-stores.md) for detailed implementation guide.

### Adding a new metadata.ErrorCode

Every `metadata.ErrorCode` that should surface to NFS and/or SMB clients is
mapped to protocol-specific status codes by the per-package `StatusFor`
switch in the adapter types packages (`internal/adapter/nfs/types`,
`internal/adapter/nfs/v4/types`, `internal/adapter/smb/types`). Adding a
new code is a one-edit-per-package contract — the enum-walk test in each
package fails loudly if a switch arm or expectation row is missing.

1. **Declare the constant** — add the new value in
   `pkg/metadata/errors/errors.go` and re-export it from
   `pkg/metadata/errors.go`.

2. **Add the switch arm + expectation row in each types package** —
   extend the `StatusFor` switch and the `expected` table in
   `statusfor_test.go` for every package whose protocol should observe
   the code:

   ```go
   case merrs.ErrFooBar:
       return nfs3types.NFS3ErrXXX
   ```

   The enum-walk test (`TestStatusFor_EnumWalk`) iterates the full
   `ErrorCode` range and fails if either the arm or the expectation row
   is missing.

3. **SMB lock-context override (if applicable)** — if the code has
   different semantics in SMB2 LOCK requests versus general I/O, give it
   an arm in `smb/types`'s `StatusForLock` (and a row in the lock
   expectation table). `StatusForLockErr` consults the lock switch;
   `StatusForErr` consults the general one.

4. **Add a test case** — pick the right tier:
   - **E2E tier** (triggerable via real NFS/SMB file operations): add a
     trigger helper in `test/e2e/helpers/error_triggers.go` and a row in
     `TestCrossProtocol_ErrorConformance` in
     `test/e2e/cross_protocol_test.go`. Expected errnos are derived at
     runtime from `nfs/types.StatusForErr` / `smb/types.StatusForErr` —
     you do not hand-transcribe protocol codes into the test table.
   - **Unit tier** (exotic codes — quota, grace-period, deadlock,
     connection-limits): add the code to the expectation table in the
     relevant `statusfor_test.go`. `TestStatusFor_EnumWalk` picks it up
     automatically and asserts every switch returns the expected value.
   - **Not sure which tier**: the enum-walk test fails on any code
     missing an expectation row, so the tier decision cannot leave the
     code uncovered.

6. **Run the test suite** — `go test -race ./internal/adapter/common/...`
   must stay green.

### Adding a New Protocol Adapter

Adapters receive a runtime reference and **interact with services, not stores directly**.

1. Create new package in `pkg/adapter/`
2. Implement `Adapter` interface:
   - `Serve(ctx)`: Start protocol server
   - `Stop(ctx)`: Graceful shutdown
   - `SetRuntime(rt any)`: Receive the runtime reference (provides access to services)
   - `Protocol()`: Return name
   - `Port()`: Return listen port
   - `Healthcheck(ctx)`: Report health from cheap, already-tracked signals
3. Use `runtime.GetBlockStoreForHandle()` for per-share block store access
4. Register in `cmd/dfs/main.go`
5. Update README with usage instructions

Embed `*adapter.BaseAdapter` for the shared TCP lifecycle (listener bind, accept loop
with backoff, connection tracking, graceful drain) instead of reimplementing it.

`SetRuntime` takes `any` rather than `*runtime.Runtime` on purpose: the adapter
interface must not import the runtime package, which imports the adapters. The
implementation type-asserts:

Example:
```go
// pkg/adapter/smb/adapter.go
type Adapter struct {
    *adapter.BaseAdapter // holds Registry *runtime.Runtime, set by SetRuntime

    config  Config
    handler *handlers.Handler
}

// SetRuntime takes any, not *runtime.Runtime: the Adapter interface lives in
// pkg/adapter, which must not import the runtime package (the runtime imports
// the adapters). BaseAdapter.SetRuntime type-asserts and panics otherwise.
func (a *Adapter) SetRuntime(rtAny any) {
    a.BaseAdapter.SetRuntime(rtAny) // sets a.Registry
    rt := rtAny.(*runtime.Runtime)

    // Protocol-specific wiring: hand the runtime to the components that need it.
    a.handler.Registry = rt
}

func (a *Adapter) handleRead(ctx context.Context, handle []byte, blockID string) ([]byte, error) {
    // Resolve the per-share block store from the file handle.
    blockStore, _ := a.Registry.GetBlockStoreForHandle(ctx, handle)
    buf := make([]byte, size)
    blockStore.ReadAt(ctx, blockID, buf, 0)
    return buf, nil
}
```

Adapters therefore reach the runtime through `a.Registry` (or a component they wired in
`SetRuntime`), not through a `rt *runtime.Runtime` field of their own — storing it directly would
reintroduce the import cycle the `any` parameter exists to avoid.

## Areas Needing Attention

### High Priority

- Additional repository backend implementations (Redis, custom)
- Performance optimization and profiling
- Test coverage expansion (especially NFSv4 test coverage)
- Protocol compliance testing
- Kerberos authentication testing

### Medium Priority

- Documentation improvements
- Example applications and tutorials
- Monitoring and observability
- Distributed PostgreSQL testing

### Future Work

- Advanced caching strategies
- Multi-region replication

## Code Guidelines

### Separation of Concerns

**Protocol handlers should ONLY handle protocol-level concerns:**
- XDR encoding/decoding
- RPC message framing
- Procedure dispatch
- Converting between wire types and internal types

**Business logic belongs in repository implementations:**
- Permission checks (`CheckAccess`)
- File creation/deletion
- Directory traversal
- Metadata updates

Example:
```go
// GOOD: Handler delegates to repository
func HandleLookup(ctx *AuthContext, dirHandle, name string) {
    // Parse XDR request
    // Call repo.Lookup(ctx, dirHandle, name)
    // Encode XDR response
}

// BAD: Handler implements permission checks
func HandleLookup(ctx *AuthContext, dirHandle, name string) {
    attr := getFile(dirHandle)
    if attr.UID != ctx.UID { /* check permissions */ }  // ❌ Wrong layer
}
```

### Error Handling

Return proper NFS error codes via `metadata.ExportError`:

```go
// Examples from metadata/errors.go
ErrNotDirectory      // NFS3ERR_NOTDIR
ErrNoEntity          // NFS3ERR_NOENT
ErrAccess            // NFS3ERR_ACCES
ErrExist             // NFS3ERR_EXIST
ErrNotEmpty          // NFS3ERR_NOTEMPTY
```

Log appropriately:
- `logger.Debug()`: Expected/normal errors (permission denied, file not found)
- `logger.Error()`: Unexpected errors (I/O errors, invariant violations)

## CI Workflows

DittoFS uses GitHub Actions with a tiered CI strategy: fast checks on PRs, comprehensive validation on push, and full matrix testing weekly.

### Workflow Overview

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose | Duration |
| ---------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- |
| `lint.yml` | PR, push | Go lint + vet + spec citations | ~2 min |
| `unit-tests.yml` | PR, push | Unit tests with race detection | ~3 min |
| `windows-build.yml` | PR, push | Windows build + unit tests | ~5 min |
| `integration-tests.yml` | push, weekly | Integration tests (S3, BadgerDB) | ~10 min |
| `e2e-tests.yml` | PR, push | E2E tests (NFS, SMB, cross-protocol, Kerberos) | ~15 min |
| `conformance.yml` | PR, push, nightly | WPTS BVT, smbtorture, pjdfstest, NFS `sec=krb5` | ~45 min |
| `smb-client-compat.yml` | push, weekly | Windows/macOS/Linux SMB client testing | ~10 min |
| `nfs-pynfs.yml` | PR, push, nightly | NFSv4 protocol conformance (pynfs) | ~20 min |
| `operator-tests.yml` | push, weekly | Operational scenario tests | ~10 min |
| `combined-tree.yml` | scheduled | Builds the tree two green PRs would produce | seconds when idle |

### Conformance suites

Every suite's profiles, variants and per-event tiering live in
[`test/conformance/suites.json`](../../test/conformance/suites.json); the rendered table is in
[testing.md](testing.md#conformance-test-suites).

### Combined-tree checks

Every workflow above tests one tree per pull request: that head merged into
`develop` as `develop` stood when the matrix ran. The tree that reaches
`develop` after two such pull requests land in sequence is tested by none of
them, and `mergeable` does not cover the gap -- it reports whether the texts
conflict, so two disjoint file lists inside one Go package merge cleanly and
can still fail to compile.

`combined-tree.yml` runs on a schedule and builds those trees. It pairs open
pull requests against `develop` whose Go packages intersect, merges them into a
detached tree, and vets and tests only the shared packages. Nothing is pushed
and no pull request is touched; the result is a job summary. A pair that does
not merge cleanly is reported and skipped rather than failing the run.

The filter is package intersection, never file overlap: file overlap is exactly
the filter that waves through the class of breakage that reaches `develop`.
The exact selection rules, and the ceilings they carry, are documented at the
top of [`.github/scripts/combined-tree.sh`](../../.github/scripts/combined-tree.sh)
-- the one place they can drift out of agreement with the code that applies
them is a second prose copy here.

### What Runs on PR (Fast, Must-Pass Before Merge)

These workflows gate pull request merges and should complete in under 5 minutes:

- **lint.yml** -- Go formatting, vetting, and linting
- **unit-tests.yml** -- All unit tests with race detection
- **windows-build.yml** -- Windows cross-compilation verification
- **conformance.yml** -- The presubmit profiles of each suite (see the table above)
- **nfs-pynfs.yml** -- NFSv4.0 + NFSv4.1 protocol conformance (memory + postgres-s3)
- **e2e-tests.yml** -- Full E2E suite including SMB3, cross-protocol, and Kerberos tests

### What Runs on Push to Develop (Comprehensive)

These run after merging to develop and should complete in under 30 minutes:

- Everything from PR checks
- **conformance.yml** -- Every profile of every suite
- **smb-client-compat.yml** -- Multi-OS client compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- **integration-tests.yml** -- Backend-specific integration tests

### What Runs Weekly (Full Matrix)

The weekly cron runs the complete test matrix (Monday mornings UTC):

- Everything from push checks
- **conformance.yml** -- Kerberos smbtorture (runs only on push/weekly, not PRs)
- **operator-tests.yml** -- Operational scenarios
- Auto-creates GitHub issues for regressions

### How to Manually Trigger Workflows

All workflows support `workflow_dispatch` for manual triggering:

```bash
# Trigger via GitHub CLI
gh workflow run conformance.yml
gh workflow run conformance.yml -f suite=smbtorture
gh workflow run smb-client-compat.yml
gh workflow run e2e-tests.yml
```

Or use the GitHub Actions UI: navigate to the workflow, click "Run workflow", and select options.

### Interpreting Conformance Test Results

When a conformance test fails in CI:

1. **Check the step summary** -- GitHub Actions provides a table with pass/fail/known counts
2. **Download artifacts** -- TRX files (WPTS) and log files (smbtorture) are uploaded as artifacts
3. **Check KNOWN_FAILURES.md** -- If the failing test is in the known failures list, it was expected
4. **For new failures:**
   - If the failure is in a genuinely unimplemented feature, add it to `KNOWN_FAILURES.md`
   - If the failure is in an implemented feature, it is a regression and needs fixing
   - Use `--keep` flag locally to leave containers running for debugging

### How to Add New CI Jobs

Follow this template pattern for new workflow jobs:

```yaml
  new-job:
    name: Descriptive Job Name
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 15
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        profile: >-
          ${{
            github.event_name == 'pull_request'
              && fromJson('["memory"]')
            || fromJson('["memory", "badger"]')
          }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run tests
        run: ./your-test-script.sh --profile ${{ matrix.profile }}
      - name: Upload results
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: results-${{ matrix.profile }}
          path: results/
          retention-days: 30
```

Key guidelines:
- Use matrix strategy with tiered profiles (memory-only on PR, all on push/weekly)
- Always set `timeout-minutes` to prevent runaway jobs
- Use `fail-fast: false` so one profile failure does not cancel others
- Upload artifacts with `if: always()` so results are available even on failure
- Add concurrency groups to prevent duplicate runs
