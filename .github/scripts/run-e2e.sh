# Runs the E2E suite passed as "$@", writes its combined output to $E2E_LOG, and
# grades the result. Exits 0 only for a run that completed and passed.
#
# The output goes to a *file*, never through a pipe. A pipe reader sees EOF only
# once every write end is closed, so one process the suite leaves behind holding
# the inherited descriptor keeps the reader — and therefore this script, and the
# whole job — alive long after the tests finished. A file has no such rendezvous:
# leaked holders are then merely leaked, not load-bearing. The file is replayed
# to stdout once it is complete and reading it cannot block.
#
# The run is bounded by E2E_WALL so that a wedge anywhere below this script fails
# *this step*. That is the property that matters: a job ended by its own timeout
# concludes `cancelled` rather than `failure`, and alarms that key on `failure`
# then stay silent. The suite runs under sudo, so the bound rests on being able
# to signal a privileged child — measured, not assumed: the self-test's
# sudo_wedge case asserts it wherever passwordless sudo is available.
#
# Grading uses both the exit status and the log: the status alone was already
# supposed to be sufficient and still lost the signal once, so a zero status
# with a log that shows no completed pass is treated as a failure.
# +e explicitly: errexit would abort before the exit status can be read, and
# reading it is the point. It is not set here, but it can arrive from the
# environment via SHELLOPTS.
