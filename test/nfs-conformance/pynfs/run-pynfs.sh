# Run the pynfs NFSv4 protocol conformance suite against DittoFS.
#
# pynfs is its own NFSv4 client: it speaks the protocol over TCP, so unlike
# pjdfstest it needs no kernel mount and no privilege. What it exercises is the
# part POSIX suites cannot see — state, sessions, owners, locking and wire error
# codes.
#
# The server is provisioned by test/posix/setup-posix.sh --no-mount, which owns
# the backend profiles (memory, badger, badger-s3). This suite
# deliberately reuses it rather than growing a second copy that would drift.
#
# Usage:
#   ./run-pynfs.sh [--profile memory] [--minor-version 4.0|4.1] [OPTIONS]

Usage: run-pynfs.sh [OPTIONS]

Run the pynfs NFSv4 protocol conformance suite against DittoFS and grade the
result against the version's KNOWN_FAILURES table.

Options:
  --profile PROFILE        Storage profile (default: memory)
                           Valid: memory badger badger-s3
                           Passed through to test/posix/setup-posix.sh.
  --minor-version VERSION  NFSv4 minor version (default: 4.0)
                           Valid: 4.0, 4.1
  --server HOST:PORT       Server to test (default: localhost:12049)
  --export PATH            Export path on the server (default: /export)
  --tests "CODES"          pynfs test codes or flags (default: all)
                           e.g. --tests "LOOK1 OPEN4", --tests lookup
  --lease-time SECONDS     NFSv4 lease time to configure (default: 30)
                           Lease-expiry tests sleep for a full lease; the 90s
                           product default makes the suite several times slower.
                           Ignored with --no-setup.
  --no-setup               Do not start or tear down a server; test whatever is
                           already listening on --server
  --keep                   Leave the server running after the run
  --verbose                Stream pynfs output as it runs
  --help                   Show this help

Examples:
  ./run-pynfs.sh --profile memory --minor-version 4.0
  ./run-pynfs.sh --minor-version 4.1 --tests "SEQ1 SEQ2" --verbose
  ./run-pynfs.sh --no-setup --server 10.0.0.5:2049
