// journal store rather than to a nil embed, so a carve path that reaches for
// another part of the interface gets that store's honest answer instead of a
// nil dereference.

// TestCarvePass_FanOutIsCappedIndependentlyOfUploadWindow proves carvePass
// carves every file exactly once, runs them concurrently, and does not let a
// narrow upload window narrow the fan-out with it: the window is pinned as
// small as it goes and carveFanOut workers still start.
//
// carveFanOut is the FLOOR, not a fixed cap — carvePass sizes the fan-out as
// max(carveFanOut, window), so a wide window widens it. This test exercises the
// floor end only; TestUploadWindow_FanOutDoesNotThrottleBelowTheWindow covers
// the other, where a fan-out frozen at carveFanOut collides with the shard
// count and throttles uploads.
//
// The two were the same semaphore once, and that is what made upload
// concurrency the product of two windows: a pass held an upload slot for its
// whole carve while the blocks inside it opened a second window on the PUTs.
// Re-coupling them would also deadlock — a pass cannot upload through a slot
// its own loop is holding.
