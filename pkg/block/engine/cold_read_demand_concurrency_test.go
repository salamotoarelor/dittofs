// TestColdRead_DemandFetchIsConcurrent pins the cold-read fix: a single read
// spanning many not-local blocks must fetch them from the remote CONCURRENTLY,
// not one blocking S3 GET per block. Before the fix the demand loop in
// EnsureAvailable was serial, which pinned cold-read throughput at
// blockSize/latency (one GET per round-trip — the ~159 MB/s wall).
//
// The assertion is STRUCTURAL, not wall-clock timing: the latency-injecting
// remote records the peak number of GETs in flight at once. Serial fetching
// pins that at 1; the bounded parallel fan-out drives it up to nBlocks. This
// keeps the test deterministic and free of timing flakes.
