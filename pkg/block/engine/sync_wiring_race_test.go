// sealingRemote is a block-keyed remote that is also its own ChunkSealer,

// the store and the sealer it type-asserts out of that same object under one
// lock. id makes the pair checkable — a snapshot whose sealer and store carry
// different ids was assembled from two different wirings.
//
// The embedded interface is nil: the test builds flush closures, it never runs
// one, so no method below SealChunk is ever called.

// TestFlushFnReadsWiringUnderLock pins two properties of the wiring read that

// those fields, and it is one snapshot rather than four reads.
//
// remoteBlockStore, chunkSealer, blockCommitter and syncedHashStore are all
// written by the setters under m.mu and were read with no lock at all. The
// detector stayed quiet because no caller re-wires a share today: both
// production callers finish wiring before Store.Start. The lock is what makes
// the setters' documented "idempotent, safe to call after construction"
// contract true of the code rather than true only of current caller order.
//
// The pairing assertion is the second property, and the one the detector
// cannot name. SetRemoteBlockStore publishes the store and its derived sealer
// together, so a snapshot pairing one wiring's sealer with another wiring's
// store can only come from reading the fields separately — exactly the design
// the single snapshot rejects.
