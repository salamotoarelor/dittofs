// TestEnsureAvailable_StraddlerDoesNotShadowLaterRow pins what a cold
// read does with two manifest rows that overlap.
//
// Coverage resolves an overlap to the greatest start, so from a later row's
// first byte it is that row that holds the bytes and the straddling row's
// remaining extent describes bytes it no longer owns. The fetch path has to
// agree: chunks download concurrently and the local tier keeps whichever
// hydrate landed last, so a straddler writing its full extent leaves its
// pre-overwrite bytes over the newer row's head — served with no error once the
// newer bytes have been evicted, which is the whole point of the cold path.
//
// Two shapes of overlap, because they fail differently. When the later row
// merely starts inside the straddler, both rows are fetched and the corruption
// is decided by which download finished last. When the later row is fully
// contained, a walk that consumed the straddler's extent never resolves the
// contained row at all, so it is never fetched.
//
// A third shape parks an unplaceable row in the same manifest. Bounding a row's
// claim needs the successor lookup, and the offset index refuses that question
// outright once any row cannot be placed — a refusal that must not be read as
// "nothing starts later", which is the row's full extent and the very claim the
// bound exists to narrow.
//
// Both store shapes are exercised because they resolve coverage and succession
// by different means — an offset index versus a manifest walk.
