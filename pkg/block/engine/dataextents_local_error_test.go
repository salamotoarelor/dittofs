// their ranges unknown rather than empty. Both callers drop the error and fall
// back to the CAS block list alone, the narrower view this function exists to
// widen, so returning the error puts a hole in the map over data that is really
// there and a sparse-copy client skips it.

// and it is what the contract above requires: uncertainty resolves toward the
// answer that forces another question.
